# Stream One Project
## *Peter Reid*


## **Overview**
The following ReadMe file is intended to guide the reader in understanding the purpose and functioning of the project I will be doing for Stream 1.

The Project will focus on a fictional travelling art gallery. It will have any different features each dealt with via the different sections of the website.

As this is a project for my education, I will be using non-copyrighted stock media for some pieces of content.


*The project will consist of 5 sections/parts, as follows:*

1. Home/Landing Page
Section 1 – Landing Hero Carousel.
Section 2 – Information About the Artists.

2. Portfolio Page

3. Contact Us Page

4. Bookings Information and Form

5. Ancillary – Navigation, etc.
